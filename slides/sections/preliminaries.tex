            \item Student Consulting/Practise Transfer: 55 hours
            \item \textbf{Overall workload: 200 hours}
        \end{itemize}
        	
        \textbf{Seminar paper and exam each count for 50\% of the module grade, both parts must receive an evaluation of at least 4.0. Remember to meet the deadlines! An extension will not be granted.}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}{Written Examination}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the \textbf{60-minute written examination} you will be tested on the \textbf{fundamental theory and methodology that underpins data science} which means that you have to \textbf{learn this script and the things we will be actively discussing during the lectures by heart} - it will make fun and it is worth it.
            \item In most cases you will be asked either in \textbf{binary-choice} or in \textbf{free-text questions} what something is, what determines how it works, what the implications are when changing the determinants, what might cause problems and how can get those problems solved. For all the topics we will be discussing during the lectures \textbf{always ask} or answer those questions by yourself - this will be the best exam preparation at all.
            \item You will also have to work on a \textbf{case study exercise} in which you are requested to \textbf{evaluate a machine learning implementation} and give reasoned proposals in order to improve it. You will of course get a \textbf{mock exam} that will be discussed in the last lecture for better orientation and preparation.
            \item And even though we will be doing \textbf{math and programming} during the lectures, you are \textbf{neither required to do math nor programming in the written examination} - however, it is more than useful to know about it.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}{Seminar Paper: Prediction Competition I/II}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Your job will be to act like a data scientist as you will be given a dataset in order to \textbf{develop a machine learning based model} that is capable of predicting in an accurate and robust manner whether or not a potential customer actually becomes a real customer.
            \item It will be up to you which method you want to choose for modeling: it could be either a simple \textbf{logistic regression model}, a \textbf{random forest} or even a more sophisticated \textbf{artificial neural network} - you will get to know the tools of the trade and how to use them appropriately.
            \item You will be also free to choose which features of the dataset you want to use in your model and which not and whether and in what manner you want to \textbf{preprocess} those features in terms of cleaning, aggregating, transforming, engineering or whatever else comes to your mind.
            \item The seminar paper which achieves the \textbf{lowest prediction error} on the features of a dataset whose actual outcome will be unknown to you will be receiving the \textbf{best grade in this partial aspect}.
        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{-1mm}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What you will be \textbf{uploading to the online campus} at the end of the semester is your \textbf{code}, a file with your \textbf{prediction results} and a \textbf{written seminar paper}.
            \item As the major focus is put on the \textbf{practical work}, the seminar paper must have \textbf{not less than four and not more than five text pages} and must contain \textbf{only those four bullet points}: an introduction (with problem definition and practical relevance), a theoretical elaboration on the chosen model, a report on how the data has been preprocessed and modeled plus an evaluation of the validation results.
            \item You may of course \textbf{form teams with up to four people} to work out a solution. However, the \textbf{seminar paper must be written independently} and its \textbf{title page must list all team members}.
        \end{itemize}
        \alert{\textbf{\textsc{Evaluation}}}
        \vspace{-1mm}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Part of the evaluation is the \textbf{appropriateness in data preprocessing, modeling and model selection} as well as detailedness, reasoned explanations and interpretations.
            \item If all those \textbf{items are graded at least 4.0} then \textbf{one third of the grade} is determined by the \textbf{goodness of the predictions}. This means that the seminar paper with the worst predictions gets a 4.0 in this particular aspect whereas the best seminar paper gets a 1.0. All other grades are interpolated between those.

    \begin{frame}{Course Description}
        The ability to \textbf{understand and work with data} has become a highly demanded major requirement both in the field of academics and business. This course offers the opportunity to dive into the area of data science by theoretically and practically exploring its fundamental principles. Several examples, live demos, and hands-on exercises during class train \textbf{data-analytic thinking} and \textbf{technical abilities} so that participants can utilize the conveyed knowledge and tools to \textbf{solve a specific empirical problem and/or practical task}. The independent solving of such problem and/or task as well as the presentation, interpretation, and critical assessment of the results is expected from the participants in a \textbf{seminar presentation} as well as in the \textbf{seminar paper}.
